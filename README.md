# Cat Painting

This project is a fun and creative example of using HTML and CSS to build a cute cat painting. It demonstrates how to use various CSS properties such as `position`, `border-radius`, `transform`, and `z-index` to design a visually appealing cat face. The cat's facial features include ears, eyes, a nose, mouth, and whiskers, all designed with precision to create a realistic cat look.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the cat face.
- `styles.css`: Contains all the necessary styles to render the cat face with CSS.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.

## Features

- **Responsive cat face**: The design is based entirely on CSS positioning and transformations.
- **Customizable**: You can modify the cat's colors, sizes, and positioning by editing the CSS properties.
- **No images used**: The entire cat face is created with CSS shapes, ensuring it's lightweight and scalable.
